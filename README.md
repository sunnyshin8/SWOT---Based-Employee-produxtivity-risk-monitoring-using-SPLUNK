# Employee Productivity SWOT Analysis using Splunk MLTK
## Complete Implementation Guide

### Project Overview
This solution implements a comprehensive employee productivity monitoring system using Splunk's Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) with a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) framework. It provides real-time insights into employee well-being, performance trends, and early warning systems for burnout and disengagement.

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Source**: Extended Employee Performance and Productivity Data (100,000+ records)
- **Format**: CSV with 20+ employee attributes
- **Splunk Configuration**: 
  - Index: `employee_productivity`
  - Sourcetype: `csv`
  - CIM Compliance: Mapped to Change, Authentication, and Performance data models

#### 2. Feature Engineering Layer
- **Productivity Score**: Composite metric including performance, work hours, projects, training
- **Engagement Score**: Based on satisfaction, training participation, promotions, attendance
- **Risk Score**: Calculated from sick days, overtime, satisfaction, resignation status
- **SWOT Categories**: Dynamically assigned based on score thresholds and clustering

#### 3. Machine Learning Models

##### K-Means Clustering (SWOT Categorization)
- **Purpose**: Segment employees into 4 SWOT categories
- **Features**: productivity_score, engagement_score, risk_score, work_life_balance_score, tenure_factor
- **Output**: Cluster assignments mapped to SWOT categories

##### Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)
- **Purpose**: Identify employees with unusual behavior patterns
- **Features**: Productivity metrics, work hours, sick days, overtime
- **Output**: Outlier detection for early intervention

##### Logistic Regression (Attrition Prediction)
- **Purpose**: Predict likelihood of employee resignation
- **Features**: All productivity and engagement metrics
- **Output**: Attrition probability and risk levels

#### 4. Visualization and Alerting Layer
- **Dashboard**: Real-time SWOT matrix visualization
- **Alerts**: Multi-level alerting system (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Reports**: Automated weekly summaries and departmental analysis

### SWOT Category Definitions

| Category | Criteria | Action Required |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Strengths** | High productivity (>3.5) + High engagement (>3.5) + Low risk (<2) | Recognition and retention focus |
| **Weaknesses** | Low-moderate productivity (2.5-3.5) + Low-moderate engagement (2.5-3.5) | Skills development and support |
| **Opportunities** | Rising performance indicators + Manageable risk | Growth and advancement planning |
| **Threats** | High risk (>4) + (Low productivity OR Low engagement) | Immediate intervention required |

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Splunk Configuration (Day 1-2)

1. **Index Setup**
```bash
# Create dedicated index
splunk add index employee_productivity
```

2. **Configuration Files Deployment**
```bash
# Copy configuration files to Splunk
cp inputs.conf $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/local/
cp props.conf $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/local/
cp savedsearches.conf $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/local/
```

3. **Data Ingestion**
```bash
# Configure data input
winpty "/c/Program Files/Splunk/bin/splunk.exe" add monitor "g:\SWOT - Based Employee produxtivity risk monitoring using SPLUNK\Extended_Employee_Performance_and_Productivity_Data.csv" -index employee_productivity -sourcetype csv
```

#### Phase 2: MLTK Model Training (Day 3-4)

1. **Install Dependencies**
```python
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy joblib
```

2. **Run Model Training**
```python
python train_mltk_models.py
```

3. **Deploy Models to Splunk**
```bash
# Copy trained models to MLTK directory
cp models/* $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_ML_Toolkit/lookups/
```

#### Phase 3: Dashboard and Alerts Setup (Day 5)

1. **Deploy Dashboard**
- Import `employee_swot_dashboard.xml` via Splunk Web UI
- Configure user permissions and access controls

2. **Configure Alerts**
- Import saved searches from `savedsearches.conf`
- Set up email notifications and webhook integrations
- Test alert triggers

#### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Day 6-7)

1. **SOAR Integration** (Optional)
- Configure webhook endpoints for automated responses
- Set up 1-on-1 meeting scheduling for high-risk employees

2. **HRMS Integration** (Future Enhancement)
- API connections to HR systems for additional context
- Automated leave management correlations

### Key Searches and Macros

#### Core Macro Definitions
```spl
# employee_base_metrics
index=employee_productivity sourcetype=csv | [feature engineering logic]

# employee_swot_assignment  
[base_metrics] | apply employee_swot_clusters | [SWOT categorization logic]

# department_swot_analysis
[swot_assignment] | stats by department | [risk calculations]
```

#### Critical Alert Searches
1. **Critical Risk Detection**: Employees requiring immediate attention
2. **Department Risk Analysis**: Departments exceeding risk thresholds  
3. **SWOT Movement Tracking**: Category changes indicating decline
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual behavior patterns
